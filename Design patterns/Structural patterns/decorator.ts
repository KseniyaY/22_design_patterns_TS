 * Decorator (Also known as: Wrapper) is a structural design pattern that lets you attach
 * new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects 
 * that contain the behaviors.
 */

/*
Aggregation: object A contains objects B; B can live without A.
Composition: object A consists of objects B; A manages life cycle
of B; B can’t live without A.

Extra note on structural specifics:
The client code would need to wrap a basic object into a set of decorators
that match the client’s preferences. The resulting objects will be structured as a stack.


The Decorator lets you structure your business logic into layers, create a decorator for each layer
and compose objects with various combinations of this logic at runtime. The client code can treat all
these objects in the same way, since they all follow a common interface.
