/**
 * https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method
 * 
 * Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define
 * a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and let subclasses override 
 * the steps without changing the overall algorithmâ€™s structure.
 * 
 * 
 * Usage examples: The Template Method pattern is quite common in TypeScript frameworks. 
 * Developers often use it to provide framework users with a simple means of extending 
 * standard functionality using inheritance.

Identification: Template Method can be recognized if you see a method in base class 
that calls a bunch of other methods that are either abstract or empty.
