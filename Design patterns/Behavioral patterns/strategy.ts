/**

 * 
Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that turns a set of behaviors into objects
and makes them interchangeable inside original context object.

The original object, called context, holds a reference to a strategy object. 
The context delegates executing the behavior to the linked strategy object. 
In order to change the way the context performs its work, other objects may replace
the currently linked strategy object with another one.

Usage examples: The Strategy pattern is very common in TypeScript code. 
Itâ€™s often used in various frameworks to provide users a way to change 
the behavior of a class without extending it.

Identification: Strategy pattern can be recognized by a method that lets 
a nested object do the actual work, as well as a setter that allows 
replacing that object with a different one.
